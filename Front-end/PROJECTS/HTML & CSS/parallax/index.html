            <P class="text">
                It is rightly said, “Jobs fill your pockets but adventures fill your soul”. Most people view adventure
                as something that is undertaken
                as a break from the mundane routine, for others adventure is a way of life.
                <br>
                <br>
                Adventure trips are all about making memories, gaining more knowledge, learning new things about the
                surroundings and about one’s own self and making lots of great stories.
                Going for an adventure camp is the best way to get all of these as it forces one to get out of their
                ordinary lives and try new things.

                Manali is a hill station nestled in the mountains of Himachal Pradesh at an altitude of 2,050 m (6,726
                ft) near the Beas River. It was Beautiful- much more than
                I had anticipated- with snow-capped mountains and valleys. The numbers of mountains surrounding us in
                the car towered high above us.
                <br>
                <br>
                It was an amazing view and eating breakfast while listening to the sounds of gushing water was a totally
                new experience. The water flows very fast and can easily carry you away if you fall in. The Beas River
                is great
                for adventures such as White water river rafting and zip lining. Just a warning- white water rafting is
                dangerous as there are many…

                Kullu, also spelled Kulu, formerly Sultanpur, town, central Himachal Pradesh state, northwestern India.
                It lies on the Beas River about 60 miles (100 km) north of Shimla, the state capital, with which it is
                linked by road.
                <br>
                <br>
                The town is an agricultural trade centre. Hand-loom weaving is the principal industry, notably the
                production of Kullu caps, shawls, handkerchiefs, and scarves. Tea, fruit, wheat, barley, and other crops
                are grown in the surrounding area, much of which is forested. In medieval times the region was part of a
                strong state of the Rajput rajas. Kullu is famous for its festivities during Dussehra
                (September–October), when the story of the epic poem Ramayana is reenacted. The town is a gateway to
                the scenic Kullu Valley, which extends northward to the source of the Beas River at Rohtang Pass. Pop.
